#### 1. Choose a topic for a website you would like to create this semester. 

##### I'm interested in either creating a website to support my Mom's writing (she's and indie e-book author), or adding to my art and web development portfolio (currently hosted on GitHub pages).

#### 2. Identify a website that you like the way it looks.

###### This one https://ljrossauthor.com/ looks appropriate for an author, and achievable for a student. 

#### 3. Create a GitHub account and make a repo connected to GitHub pages, index.html page.

##### This should work! ðŸ¤ž

#### 4. Submit the URL to your GitHub Pages website, along with a link to your repo.
